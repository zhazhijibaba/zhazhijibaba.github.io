### Weaire-Phelan Structure  
The building of Water Cube in Beijing is made of the Weaire-Phelan structure, which is made up of wonky dodecahedrons with pentagonal faces and tetradecahedrons with 2 hexagonal and 12 pentagonal faces (bottom right).  
To make the bubble blocks, run  
```
make_bubbles_mesh.py
```
The resuling structure model and 3D prints is showed below:

#### Water Cubes  
To make Water Cube structure, run  
```
cut_cube_bubbles_mesh.py
```
The resuling structure model and 3D prints is showed below:

#### water Sphere
To make Water Sphere structure, run  
```
cut_sphere_bubbles_mesh.py
```
